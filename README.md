# Calculator Checklist

A project created out of curiosity to test the waters of SwiftUI, Apple's new UI Framework.

The caculator-checklist concept was originally designed by [Juan Fer](https://twitter.com/juanfer_ux) made available on UpLabs. Big shoutout to him for creating these beautiful microinteractions and opensourcing the design files! We surely need more designers like him.

See the originial design presentation [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/4856079-Calculator-on-Checklist-Concept).
